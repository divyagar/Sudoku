# Sudoku

- This project is a desktop application which is created using Python and Tkinter. In this project a partially filled 9×9 2D array is given in which user has to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.
